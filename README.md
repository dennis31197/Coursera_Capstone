# Coursera_Capstone
This repository is for the Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone Project.
This is my first Data Science project. So for me the most important thing was that I learn how to use the differet tools of the course to get to an answer. Even if the findings are not groundbreaking, I learned a lot doing this project and I can use this knowledge to approach bigger and more relevant projects in the furture.
